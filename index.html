<a href="http://www.travelchannel.com/interests/travel-tips/articles/top-10-vacation-spots">Here</a> are the Travel channel's recommendations on their idea of the top vacation spots.
<p>This is a great resource because they combine images and video. They provide a preview for the main article with a link to continue reading instead of filling the page with the whole article. This allows them to promote their other content. They also have a pop up window that invites the reader to sign up for their newsletter. The biggest downfall is that there are <i>a lot </i> of ads. However, they are balanced and do not obscure the content.</p>
